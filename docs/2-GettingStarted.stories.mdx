# Getting Started

## Installing

You can install REAVIZ with [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/reaviz) or Yarn.

- NPM: `npm install reaviz --save`
- YARN: `yarn add reaviz`

#### Development Builds

Our continuous integration server runs all tests on every commit to master and
if they pass it will publish a new development build to NPM and tag it with the `@dev` tag.
This means that if you want the bleeding edge of `reaviz` you can simply do:

```bash
yarn add reaviz@dev
```

This will install the version currently tagged as `@dev`. Your `package.json` file will be
locked to that specific version.

```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "reaviz": "3.0.0-dev-master.a0d076d"
  }
}
```

If you later want to again update to the bleeding edge, you will have to run the above command again.

## Configuration

To customize various elements in the charts,
we use [CSS Variables](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_variables).
This gives you fine grain control over the styles
that is native to the browser. The color variables are:

- `--color-background`
- `--color-on-background`
- `--color-layer-transparent`
- `--color-surface`
- `--color-primary`
- `--color-on-primary`

These names are based on the Google Material design spec. These variables
are not setup when you install the project automatically but if you want
some sensible defaults here is what we use in the Storybook demo:

```html
<style>
  body {
    --color-background: #22272b;
    --color-on-background: #fff;
    --color-layer-transparent: rgba(0, 5, 11, 0.9);
    --color-surface: #2c343a;
    --color-primary: #67c2e4;
    --color-on-primary: #fff;
    --color-on-surface: #fff;
  }
</style>
```

## Compatibility

REAVIZ is compatible with React v16+ and works with ReactDOM. React Native is not supported at this time.
